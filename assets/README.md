# VLY Coin Logo

This directory contains the VLY coin logo assets.

## Files needed:
- vly-logo.png - The main VLY coin logo (referenced in README.md)
- vly-logo.svg - Vector version of the logo (optional)

## Logo Usage:
The logo is used in the main README.md file to represent the VLY blockchain project.

## Current Status:
A placeholder file `vly-logo.placeholder` has been created. To complete the implementation:

1. Replace `vly-logo.placeholder` with the actual logo image file (`vly-logo.png`)
2. The logo is already referenced in README.md as `![VLY Logo](assets/vly-logo.png)`
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
4. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger for high-resolution displays

Note: The actual logo image should be placed here and referenced as `assets/vly-logo.png` in the README.md file.
